// Here's a breakdown of the components we'll create:
// - Header: This component will contain the top section of your website, such as a logo and navigation menu.
// - MainContent: This component will hold the main content of your homepage.
// - Footer: This component will include information like copyright, links, and contact details at the bottom of the page.
